# Julian Loaiza Botero - Web Developer

Hi, I'm **Julian**! I'm a **Web Developer** with over **4+ years** of experience in the tech industry, primarily working as a freelancer. I've also collaborated with remote teams working in **fintech** by engaging with clients and meeting tight deadlines to deliver quality solutions. I feel most confident with **Laravel** full-stack development and **Linux** desktop environments.

In my work experience, I have developed applications that enabled the clients to use technology to improve their business.

I have a deep interest in audio technology. I'm currently on a self-study journey to learn audio digital signal processing (DSP) and C++ with the goal of developing audio plugins. This exploration into the technical side of music complements my practical experience as a musician.

I started my professional life as a session musician, and over the past 15 years, I've had the privilege of touring internationally, composing scores for television, and arranging music for small horn and string ensembles. I've played multiple instruments—including bass, upright bass, piano, and guitar—on more than 50 recordings.

Do I sound like a good fit for your team? Get in touch!
